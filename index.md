## About Me

I am a PostDoc at the [German Cancer Research Center](https://www.dkfz.de/en/). Under supervision from Lena Maier-Hein I am leading the subgroup of [Intelligent Systems in Surgery and Endoscopy (ISSE)](https://www.dkfz.de/en/imsy/our-team) in the division of [Intelligent Medical Systems](https://www.dkfz.de/en/imsy/). 

My research revolves around computer vision and deep learning â€“ with a special focus on building systems that are continual, data-efficient and well validated. My research interests include Lifelong Learning, Medical Imaging, Transfer-Learning, Meta-Learning, Multi-Task-Learning, Auto-ML and Continual-Learning. 

Previously, I studied Math (Bachelor 2015, Master 2019) and Computer Science (Bachelor 2018) at [Heidelberg University](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en), specializing at their intersection: [theoretical computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science).
